# Introduction to R - Part III Systems Biology

This is a general introduction to R for data analysis. 

Our practicals will be very hands-on, focusing on learning the necessary syntax 
to allow you to do data analysis in R, from data manipulation to visualisation. 
We will focus on tabular data, which is general enough to allow you to apply 
these skills to a wide range of problems. 

If you have any queries please contact Hugo Tavares (<hugo.tavares@slcu.cam.ac.uk>) 
 or [post an issue](https://github.com/tavareshugo/R-intro-Cambridge-SysBio/issues)
on our GitHub repository.

**Setup**

All necessary software and data will be available on the training machines at 
the Bioinformatics Training Room 
([Craik-Marshall Building](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en-GB&q=Craik-Marshall+Building,+Downing+Site,+Cambridge&source=calendar)).

However, you are welcome to use your own laptop, in which case you need to:

* Download and install R ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/))
* Download and install RStudio ([here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))
* Open RStudio and go to `Tools > Install Packages` and paste this into the "Packages" field: `tidyverse`

<!--
Our sessions will be running live online. 
**Please check your email for details of how to access the course environment.**

- The lesson will run via zoom 
(<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86850842355?pwd=VlJoK2dMYlRvUDExdDkyejlaSjJKZz09" target="_blank">link</a>)
- We will use a shared GDoc for you to post questions and share other bits of information
(<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CzHh9Pf92IIFEDVLg58ZRClUFeDAOUrIAkmr8DVFDBk" target="_blank">link</a>)
- We will use a virtual R environment that you can access from your internet browser. You will receive the details for login by email.

Please use the virtual R environment during the course. 
However, to setup R on your own computer (to use after the course):

* Download and install R ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/))
* Download and install RStudio ([here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))
* Open RStudio and go to `Tools > Install Packages` and paste this into the "Packages" field: `tidyverse,naniar,broom,corrplot,patchwork,ggfortify`

### INT1.23 / INT1.26 / INT1.30

These lessons will cover the basics of using R with RStudio.

### INT1.33

* <a href="https://tavareshugo.github.io/data_carpentry_extras/data_structures_functions_loops/data_structures_functions_loops.html" target="_blank">Data Structures, Functions and Loops</a>

<!--
- Detail object types and how they relate to each other. See: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html and https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html
    - atomic vector (aka vector), list (recursive vector), matrix (vector with 2 dims), data.frame (list of equal-length vectors), array (vector with n dims) - and how they relate to each other. 
    - could give example of `lm()` output being a list?
    - could give example of DESeq2 having matrix objects?
    - example of image data being an array
- Functions
- Iterate through vectors (or lists)

This lesson will be focusing on an exercise that allows to apply the skills learned 
in the previous lessons, as well as a few new tricks to automate tasks in R.
