# Introduction to R - Part III Systems Biology

This is a general introduction to R for data analysis. 

Our practicals will be very hands-on, focusing on learning the necessary sintax 
to allow you to do data analysis in R, from data manipulation to visualisation. 
We will focus on tabular data, which is general enough to allow you to apply 
these skills to a wide range of problems. 

Below, we provide links to detailed materials for your reference, many of 
which were developed by the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org) organisation.

If you have any queries please contact Hugo Tavares (<hugo.tavares@slcu.cam.ac.uk>) 
or Matt Castle (<mdc31@cam.ac.uk>) or [post a new issue](https://github.com/tavareshugo/R-intro-Cambridge-SysBio/issues) 
on our GitHub repository.

**Setup**

All necessary software and data will be available on the training machines at 
the Bioinformatics Training Room 
([Craik-Marshall Building](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?hl=en-GB&q=Craik-Marshall+Building,+Downing+Site,+Cambridge&source=calendar)).

However, you are welcome to use your own laptop, in which case you need to:

* Download and install R ([here](https://cran.r-project.org/))
* Download and install RStudio ([here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download))
* Install the R package `tidyverse` (open RStudio and go to `Tools > Install Packages`)
* Download the data for the lesson ([here](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169))
